SQL JOINS
=========
--> JOIN means to combine something.
--> A JOIN clause is used to combine data from two or more table based on related column (same column) between them.

Example
========
employee
department
manager
projects

note --> column name does not matter in join 
     --> values is matter in join values must be same

Types
====
1: inner join / JOIN
--------------------
--> only the record which are prsent in both table will be fetch.

	syntax
	-------
		SELECT cloumn_name, ..
		FROM TABLE_NAME1 t1 
		INNER JOIN TABLE_NAME2 t2 
		ON CONDITION;


	
-- Fetch the epmloyee name and department name the  belongs tovy 
-- INNER JOIN  / JOIN


	example
	-------
		select e.emp_name, d.dept_name
		from EMPLOYEE e 
		inner join DEPARTMENT d 
		on e.dept_id = d.dept_id;



left join / left outer join
===========================
--> left join do 2 things 
--> left join  ===> inner join + any addition record in the left table 
--> if join condition is fail to matching a record from left table to right table it will retrurn "null".

-- Fetch all the employee name and department name the  belongs tovy 
-- LEFT JOIN  
-- left join  ===> inner join + any addition record in the left table


	example
	-------
		select e.emp_name, d.dept_name
		from EMPLOYEE e 
		left join DEPARTMENT d 
		on e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

right join / left outer join
============================
--> right join do 2 things 
--> right join  ===> inner join + any addition record from the right table 
--> if join condition is fail to matching a record from left table to right table it will retrurn "null".

-- Fetch all the employee name and department name the  belongs tovy 
-- RIGHT JOIN  
-- right join  ===> inner join + any addition record in the right table


	example
	-------
		select e.emp_name, d.dept_name
		from EMPLOYEE e 
		right join DEPARTMENT d 
		on e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

Full outer join / full join
===========================
--  full outer join

-- Full join  = Inner join
-- 				+ all remaining records left table (return null value for any columns fetch) 
-- 				+ all remaining records right table table (return null value for any columns fetch) 

-- Full join  = Inner join + Left join + Right join

	example
	--------
		select e.emp_name,d.dept_name
		from employee e 
		full join department d on d.dept_id = e.dept_id;


CROSS JOIN
==========
--> CROSS JOIN return cartesion product
--> cross join does not need a join condition (does not used "on" cluase)
--> A table can not be join with any of with other table but still u want to get information from that table that time go for the cross join.



-- CROSS JOIN
-- return cartesian product
--> cross join does not need a join condition (does not used "on" cluase)
--> it join every single record from left table to every single record from right table (8*6 = 48)

	example
	--------
		select e.emp_name, d.dept_name
		from employee e ---> emp table having 8 record
		cross join department d;  --> department table having 6 record
		--> result = 8 * 6 = 48
		
-- example when we used cross join		
--> write a query to fetch the employee name and their corresponding department name.
--> also make sure to display the company name and the company location corresponding to each employee

		select e.emp_name, d.dept_name,c.company_name,c.company_location
		from employee e
		inner join department d on d.dept_id = e.dept_id
		cross join company c;

NATURAL JOIN
============
-- Nature join --> never used natural join because you giving the control to sql to join the table based on join condition
-->In Nature join sql will decide what is a join condition not by the user them self
-->In Nature join we can not used condition or (on cluase ) sql will define the condition
--> if columns are present in the both table with same name that time it perform inner join.
--> In Nature join is lool ilke inner join but in inner join user will define join condition and in In Nature join sql will define join condition
--> if columns are present in the both table with differnt name name that time it perform cross join.

	example
	--------
		select e.emp_name,d.dept_name
		from employee e
		natural join department d;


INNER JOIN --> Fetching only matching record only from both tables.

LEFT JOIN --> Fetching all record from left table and matching record from right table.
		(inner join + additional record from left table)

RIGHT JOIN --> Fetching all record from right table and matching record from left table.
		(inner join + additional record from right table)

FULL JOIN  --->  Inner join + Left join + Right join

CROSS JOIN --> it join every single record from left table to every single record from right table (8*6 = 48)
